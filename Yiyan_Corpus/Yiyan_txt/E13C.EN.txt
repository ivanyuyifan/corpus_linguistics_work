Sherried squash soup 
A good soup soon becomes a fail safe recipe for any occasion. 
You can always miss out the sherry if making for children
Ingredients
Serves 4
1 large onion, halved 
dry (fino) sherry
1 kg butternut squash peeled, deseeded and chopped 
600 ml hot vegetable stock (we like Marigold)
seed bread croutons and flat leaf parsley
olive oil
Method
Fry the onion in the oil for 5 mins until softened. 
Add the sherry and squash and sizzle for 1-2 mins. 
Pour in the stock, then cover and simmer for 20 mins until the squash is tender when pierced with a knife.
Whizz in a food processor until smooth. Will keep in the fridge for 2 days, or freeze for 6 weeks. 
When ready to eat, reheat until bubbling and serve in small portions topped with seed-bread croutons (see above right) and a parsley sprig.
