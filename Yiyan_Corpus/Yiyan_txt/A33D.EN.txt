Man Booker prize shortlist 2014 includes US authors for the first time
British writers have clinched three spots on the Man Booker prize shortlist after the UK's most prestigious literary award opened its doors to writers of any nationality for the first time in its 46-year history.
The move, intended to embrace "the freedom of English in all its vigour, its vitality, its versatility and its glory wherever it may be", had prompted fears that the heavyweights of American literature would dominate the British award. 
But in the event, two US writers have made the final round of this year's award: Joshua Ferris and Karen Joy Fowler.
Ferris and Fowler make the final six alongside the Australian writer Richard Flanagan, with three British writers shortlisted for the ?50,000 award this year: former winner Howard Jacobson, Neel Mukherjee, and Ali Smith.
