Appeal history:
- A revised emergency appeal was launched on 20 November 2008 for 167.1 million (USD 137.7 million or EUR 110 million) to assist 200,000 families (up to 1,000,000 people) for 31 months.
- An emergency appeal was launched on 30 May 2008 for CHF 96.7 million (USD 92.7 million or EUR 59.5 million) in response to the huge humanitarian needs and in recognition of the unique position of the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) supported by Red Cross Red Crescent partners to deliver high quality disaster response and recovery programmes.
- A preliminary emergency appeal of CHF 20.1 million (USD 19.3 million and EUR 12.4 million) was issued on 15 May 2008 to support the RCSC to assist around 100,000 people affected by the earthquake for 12 months.
- CHF 250,000 (USD 240,223 or EUR 155,160) was allocated from the International Federation's Disaster Relief Emergency Fund (DREF) on 12 May 2008, to support the RCSC to immediately start assessments of the affected areas and distribute relief items.
Summary: Ten months after China was struck by the earthquake, the restoration and reconstruction initiatives of rural houses in the quake zone is being accelerated to ensure that all affected families are able to return to their new houses before the end of the year.
In the month of March, there have been major changes in the organizational structure of the RCSC headquarters, including the earthquake reconstruction office. 
The RCSC Regional Partnership Meeting (to include Regional HIV, DPRK CAS, Mongolia CAS, and Sichuan Earthquake meetings) will be held on the 23- 26 April in Hainan.
The International Federation was informed by the Mianzhu government that all rural reconstruction initiatives must have started by 12 May 2009. 
The main work should be completed by the end of September and the final finishing works must be completed by the end of December 2009. 
The International Federation is supporting the goal to finalise reconstruction before the end of 2009 but expects that many beneficiaries might not be able to meet this goal due to constraints such as lack of funding or living, in remote areas.
On 31 March, International Federation's programmes were suspended again despite a signed memorandum of understanding due to local governments' increasing concerns of social unrest related to equity issues in housing reconstruction.
The Japanese Red Cross and Canadian Red Cross representatives visited the Jiulung and Zundao townships respectively in early March. 
Visitors to Chengdu in March also included a representative from CIDA and AUSAID.
Many partner national societies have made contributions to the appeal: American Red Cross/American government, Australian Red Cross/Australian government, Belgian Red Cross/Belgian government, British Red Cross, Bulgarian Red Cross, Canadian Red Cross/Canadian government, Cook Islands Red Cross, Croatian Red Cross, Czech Red Cross, Danish Red Cross/Danish government, Estonian Red Cross, Finnish Red Cross/Finnish government, German Red Cross, Icelandic Red Cross/ Icelandic government, Indian Red Cross, Iran Red Crescent, Irish Red Cross/ Irish government, Japanese Red Cross/Japanese government, Lithuanian Red Cross, Malaysian Red Crescent, Mauritius Red Crescent, Monaco Red Cross, Netherlands Red Cross/Netherlands government, New Zealand Red Cross/New Zealand government, Norwegian Red Cross/Norwegian government, Qatar Red Crescent, Singapore Red Cross, Spanish Red Cross, Swedish Red Cross/ Swedish government, Sri Lanka Red Cross, Turkish Red Crescent and United Arab Emirates Red Crescent Society, as well as contributions from American, Greek, Italian, Luxembourg, Slovenian and South Africa governments, OPEC Fund for International Development, the Stavros Niarchos Foundation and many corporate partners.
