The Lifestyle That Is Best For The Aging Brain
Older adults who have a busy lifestyle also have better cognitive function, new research reports.
The results come from one of the most comprehensive studies of how the brain changes with age: The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study.
Dr Sara Festini, the study's first author, said: "
We show that people who report greater levels of daily busyness tend to have better cognition, especially with regard to memory for recently learned information.
Living a busy lifestyle appears beneficial for mental function, although additional experimental work is needed to determine if manipulations of busyness have the same effect." 
The Dallas Lifespan Brain Study included 330 people aged between 50 and 89.
Their daily routines were recorded along with their cognitive performance.
The results showed that whatever age they were, the brains of people who were busier worked better.
