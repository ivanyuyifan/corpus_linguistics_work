The Search for Mrs. Bach
In 2006, Martin Jarvis, a Welsh-born musician who teaches at Charles Darwin University, in Australia, aired a startling theory about Johann Sebastian Bach, the undisputed arch-magus of the Western classical tradition. 
Jarvis proposed that Bach¡¯s six suites for solo cello¡ªof which Pablo Casals once said, ¡°They are the very essence of Bach, and Bach is the essence of music¡±¡ªare, in fact, the work of Anna Magdalena Bach, the composer¡¯s second wife. 
In 2011, Jarvis elaborated his ideas in a book entitled ¡°Written by Mrs Bach¡±; he is now presenting them in the form of a documentary film, also titled ¡°Written by Mrs Bach.¡± 
Various publications, including the Washington Post, U.S.A Today, and the Web site Jezebel, have propagated Jarvis¡¯s views. 
¡°Obviously, Bach is not a complete fraud,¡± Isha Aran wrote on Jezebel, conceding that Bach¡¯s r¨¦sum¨¦ remains an impressive one even without the cello suites.
This is not the first time that doubts have surfaced about famous works in the Bach catalogue. 
For example, the attribution of the Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, which will reverberate in many a haunted house this Halloween, has been repeatedly questioned, with many scholars detecting features that are atypical of Bach¡¯s style. 
Nowhere else in his organ music does Bach make prominent use of octave doubling, as in the opening measures of the Toccata: it¡¯s a showy, brazen gesture that suggests a quite different creative personality from the one who produced the St. Matthew Passion. The formidable Bach scholar Christoph Wolff argues, however, that such flamboyance could be the product of a ¡°youthful and unrestrained¡± composer¡ªbad-boy Bach, as it were. The debate remains unresolved.
