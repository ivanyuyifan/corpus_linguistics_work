Easy Ways to Wash Out Tea Stains 
Remedies for removing tea stains.
Baking Soda 
Don't let those annoying coffee and/or tea stains on your good china spoil another special occasion. 
Remove them by dip-ping a moist cloth in baking soda to form a stiff paste and gently rubbing your cups and saucers. 
Rinse clean and dry, then set your table with pride.
Beer
Getting that coffee or tea stain out your rug may seem impossible, but you can literally lift it out by pouring a bit of beer right on top. 
Rub the beer lightly into the material, and the stain should disappear. 
You may have to repeat the process a couple of times to remove all traces of the stain.
Salt
Tea and coffee leave stains on cups and in pots. 
You can easily scrub away these unattractive rings by sprinkling salt onto a sponge and rubbing in little circles across the ring. 
If the stain persists, mix white vinegar with salt in equal proportions and rub with the sponge.
Vinegar
You can lift out many water-soluble stains-including beer, orange and other fruit juices, black coffee or tea, and vomit-from your cotton-blend clothing by patting the spot with a cloth or towel moistened with undiluted white vinegar just before placing it in the wash. 
For large stains, you may want to soak the garment overnight in a solution of 3 parts vinegar to 1 part cold water before washing.
WD-40
To remove tea stains from countertops, spray a little WD-40 on a sponge or damp cloth and wipe the stain away.
