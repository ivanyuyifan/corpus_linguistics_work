-- Air net revenue (which consists of revenue from standalone air bookings) was $60 million in the third quarter, down 31 percent (30 percent on a constant currency basis) from the third quarter of 2008. Domestic air net revenue declined 32 percent due to the removal of booking fees in early April on flights booked through Orbitz.com and CheapTickets.com, offset in part by higher air transactions as a result of both lower fees and lower air fares.
