Rumsfeld: Bush Was Wrong for Not Accepting Resignation
Donald Rumsfeld holds the distinction of being the second-longest serving Secretary of Defense in U.S. history. 
His most recent tenure as the civilian head of military forces began in the months before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and ended just after the 2006 U.S. midterm elections. 
Under President George W. Bush, he oversaw the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, and in a new memoir he opens up about the decisions and missteps involved in those military operations.
Rumsfeld admits one of the lowest points of his professional career came in 2004, when photographs surfaced showing U.S. military service members mistreating prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.
"And then out of the blue come these photographs --- just heartbreaking. It is like you have been punched in the stomach. 
And you think to yourself here are these wonderful young men and women in our service, and their reputations are stained by the people who abused those people that were in our custody. 
It was disgraceful, it was perverted, it was disgusting, it was heartbreaking, and I was just sick about it," he said.
Intense international condemnation of the abuse, and public scrutiny on how the Secretary of Defense was handling the allegations, led to the first of several instances in which Rumsfeld submitted his resignation to President George. W. Bush.. 
"He rejected it, and the next day or three days later. 
I submitted it again and told him I thought that was a mistake and that I should leave. Someone's head ought to roll," Rumsfeld said.
In his new memoir, Rumsfeld maintains that President Bush was wrong for not accepting his resignation in the wake of the scandal.
