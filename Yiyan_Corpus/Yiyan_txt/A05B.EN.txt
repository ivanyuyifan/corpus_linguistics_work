The Real Challenge From China: Its People, Not Its Currency 
I love the idea of bipartisanship. 
Just the image of Democrats and Republicans coming together makes me smile. 
"Finally " I say to myself "American government is working." 
But then I look at what they actually agree on and I begin to pine for paralysis.
On Sept. 29 the House of Representatives passed a bill with overwhelming support from both Democrats and Republicans. 
It would punish China for keeping its currency undervalued by slapping tariffs on Chinese goods. 
Everyone seems to agree that it's about time. 
But it isn't. 
The bill is at best pointless posturing and at worst dangerous demagoguery. 
It won't solve the problem it seeks to fix. 
More worrying it is part of growing anti-Chinese sentiment in the U.S. that misses the real challenge of China's next phase of development.
There's no doubt that China keeps the renminbi its currency undervalued so it can help its manufacturers sell their toys sweaters and electronics cheaply in foreign markets especially the U.S. and Europe. 
But this is only one of a series of factors that have made China the key manufacturing base of the world. (The others include low wages superb infrastructure hospitality to business compliant unions and a hard-working labor force.)
