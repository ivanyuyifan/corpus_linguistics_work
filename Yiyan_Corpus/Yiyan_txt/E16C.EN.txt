Dan Lepard's artisan cheese cracker recipes
Two real crackers to liven up any cheeseboard ¡§C one made with spelt and oats, the other with polenta and olive oil
Dan Lepard's artisan crackers: Add a touch of class to any cheeseboard.
The uniform shapes and industrial look of factory crackers are one of the key parts of the traditional British cheeseboard, and I do have a sneaky fondness for them. 
But pair carefully handmade crackers with our best cheeses, and you get a more flattering effect. 
Simple to make and easy to top with seeds, herbs, spices or salt.
Spelt and oat crackers
Like a digestive, and good with blue and soft cheeses. Makes about 30 small crackers.
250g spelt flour, plus a little extra for rolling
25g dark brown sugar
1/2 tsp bicarbonate of soda
1/2 tsp salt
125g unsalted butter, softened75g rolled oats, 50ml cold milk, plus extra to finish 
Put the flour, sugar, bicarb and salt in a bowl, and evenly rub in the butter. 
Stir in the oats, then mix in the milk until you have a smooth dough. 
Roll the dough about 0.5cm thick, cut into 8cm squares and place on a tray lined with nonstick baking paper. 
Brush with milk, prick all over with a fork and bake at 170C (150C fan-assisted)/335F/gas mark 3 for about 25-30 minutes, until crisp.
Olive oil polenta crackers 
Crisp and snappy, so they can hold up to firmer cheeses such as cheddar. 
Makes about 15 large ones
25g uncooked polenta or coarse cornmeal
1 tsp honey
50ml olive oil
300g plain flour, plus more for rolling
1/2 tsp baking powder
3/4 tsp salt 
Pour 75ml boiling water over the polenta, stir and leave to swell for five minutes. 
Stir in the honey and oil. 
Tip the flour, baking powder and salt into a bowl, add the polenta and about 50ml cold water, and mix to a dough. 
Knead for 10-15 seconds, until smooth, then wrap well and leave for 15 minutes, to make it easier to roll. 
Pinch off walnut-sized balls of dough (about 30g), roll very thinly into slipper shapes and lay on a tray lined with nonstick paper. 
Brush with water and bake at 200C (180C fan-assisted)/390F/gas mark 6 for 10-12 minutes, until golden and crisp.
