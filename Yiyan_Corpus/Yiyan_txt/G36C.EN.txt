Grace Kelly¡®s Forever Look
The rare beauty and stunning self-possession that propelled Grace Kelly into the Hollywood pantheon, onto the Best-Dressed List, and ultimately to Monaco¡®s royal palace were more than captivating-they were completely genuine. 
As London¡®s Victoria and Albert Museum unveils an exhibition devoted to Kelly¡®s style, which still inspires fashion from Herm¡§¡§s to Tommy Hilfiger to Mad Men¡®s costumer Janie Bryant, the author looks at the intertwined qualities of an icon: white-gloved ing¡§?nue, elegant goddess, passionate-and frankly sexual-romantic.

It may be the softest kiss in film history. The sun is setting over West Side rooftops, the sky persimmon. 
A man, his leg in a cast, sleeps near an open window, undisturbed by a neighbor singing scales. 
Just after the highest note is reached, a shadow climbs over the man¡®s chest, shoulder, and chin. 
We see a face: blue eyes, red lips, skin like poured cream, pearls. 
The kiss happens in profile, a slow-motion hallucinatory blur somewhere between myth and dream, a limbic level of consciousness.
