The burden of obesity is no small issue
Working in a diabetes clinic, I see first hand the ever increasing levels of obesity and diabetes.
The statistic is shocking - cases have increased by more than one million over the last decade.
Health problems related to obesity represent an enormous threat to the UK population's health.
Obesity is no longer exceptional - in fact, the majority of people in many age groups are now obese.
This is very alarming when you consider that obesity-related diabetes can take 10-15 years to develop and we are yet to fully see how severely it will affect many people's health.
It's worrying thing that we live in an environment that encourages weight gain: food is more affordable and available than ever, and we are far more sedentary that we were 30, 20 or even 10 years ago.
But as obesity becomes increasingly 'normal', it is harder to get people to appreciate the risks.
A lot of people - particularly men - don't regard being three or four stone overweight as being a problem, but that extra weight creates a significant health risk.
With Type 2 Diabetes, getting patients to appreciate the severity of their condition is even more important.
Because Diabetes impacts almost every aspect of life and diet, exercise and weight control go alongside therapy which requires discipline from patients.
When people think about obesity they look at morbid obesity, which represents a tiny minority of cases.
In terms of the burden on healthcare and future disease problems, it's the people who are three to four stone overweight that we need to worry about most.
With more obese people than ever, we need to better understand which patients are at a greatest risk of obesity related health problems.
It's very clear that all fat is not created equal and where fat is stored in the body has an extremely strong influence our health.
Storing fat under the skin seems to be healthier because these fat cells don't function as dynamically.
