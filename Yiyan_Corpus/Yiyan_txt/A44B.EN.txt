China gets the 2022 winter Olympics
IN 2022 the Winter Olympics will be held in a place with no snow. 
On July 31st the International Olympic Committee awarded the games to Beijing, to be held in the city of Zhangjiakou, 250km (150 miles) north of the capital. 
The resort beat Almaty in Kazakhstan, the only other remaining city left in the bid. 
China has many tasks to complete in the next seven years to ready itself. Among them is to make some snow.
When any city is awarded the Olympics, questions quickly follow about the country¡¯s ability to build the appropriate infrastructure in time¡ªand how much it will cost. 
These cause less anxiety in China. 
In its bid the country highlighted its prowess at building fancy stadia, zippy high-speed rail and other transport links on time. 
Beijing has already hosted a successful summer Olympics¡ªmaking it the first city ever to host both. 
In terms of the cost, the government deems no price tag too high for the prestige of staging the Olympics, yet another symbol of China¡¯s growing pre-eminence in the world.
More worrying is China¡¯s ambition to stage the winter Olympics¡ªand launch a winter sports industry¡ªin an arid desert (Zhangjiakou is near the Gobi). 
Almost every winter Olympics venue uses artificial snow to supplement their own supply, and to ensure a plentiful supply of the best kind. 
But most have far more of their own to start with. 
China does have areas which are covered in the real stuff through the winter, but these lay farther away from the capital, to the far north and north-east.
