The foreigners keeping kabuki alive
Makoto Nishimura is keeping the art of Japanese kabuki alive through an unlikely group of students.
In Tokyo¡¯s Meguro ward, Makoto Nishimura¡¯s small apartment is a trove of traditional Japanese instruments. 
Hanging in front of her bookshelf is a row of three-stringed shamisen (a type of square-shaped lute) wrapped elegantly in kimono fabric. 
Other instruments used for kabuki performances ¨C such as flutes, drums and a 13-stringed Japanese harp called a koto ¨C sit off to the side in and around the bookshelf. But just like in a kabuki ensemble, the shamisen take centre stage.
Nishimura¡¯s first encounter with a shamisen was as a 17-year-old high school student when her mother took her to meet Hiroaki Kikuoka, a well-known music professor.
Kikuoka encouraged her to take up the instrument and mentored Nishimura for more than 25 years ¨C even offering free shamisen lessons as she struggled as a working mother of two. 
This kindness inspired a strong sense of gratitude within Nishimura, and she soon opened a home studio to pass her knowledge of kabuki music on to future generations.
Though modern acts like the Yoshida Brothers have updated shamisen¡¯s image, the art is slowly disappearing as young Japanese gravitate towards pop music.
