"People shouldn't spread stories," she said.
"Not unless they know all the facts."
The facts, it turned out, were fairly straightforward.
Bobby Curran had been drinking in the White Swan when Des Cronin and his brothers came by.
There had been bad blood between Des and Bobby since they'd got into a drunken argument about a motorcycle at Dave Mooney's Christmas party.
Everybody knew the affair wasn't over, but nothing happened until that night in the Swan, six months later, when Des and his brothers found Bobby alone and half-cut in a place where he hardly ever drank.
The Cronins were too scared of Bobby to have a square go with him; even that night, when it was three against one, they didn't do anything right away, because none of them were carrying.
They couldn't have fought it out with fists and boots, like in the old days-they had to be armed.
Since Des lived right across the road, all that was needed was someone to keep an eye on Bobby so he didn't leave while the Cronins ran back to Des's flat for some blades.
Stan was the one who kept Bobby talking while the boys got themselves ready.
Then, when Bobby went out back to the toilets, he gave the Cronins the signal and they went in.
It was over in seconds: Bobby probably didn't even know what hit him.
The Cronins ran out, their clothes covered in blood, but nobody tried to stop them.
Jim the Landlord came around the bar and went out the back to see what had happened, and he did first aid on Bobby while somebody called the police and most of his custom melted away, not wanting to be there when the law arrived.
