Decorating With Orange: How to Incorporate a Risky Color, Tastefully 
If you've paid attention to fashion runways and magazines at all this year, you've probably noticed a lot of orange. 
This warm color, and its many hues, has been somewhat of an "it" color for the past couple of years - from pink-orange corals to yellow-orange and golden variants, it's everywhere from walls, to beds and cushions.
Regardless of how popular this color may be on Parisian catwalks, many people are still wary of implementing this color into their home decor. 
However, while orange may seem a bit zany, there are plenty of ways to integrate this color stylishly. 
Here are a few tips!
If you're a little shy about bringing orange into your home, start by adding touches of orange into outdoor spaces. 
One thing to note about orange is that it is a very energetic and lively color. 
Thus, it works well in places where you anticipate lots of activity - such as your outdoor patio space or sun room. 
Use the color in the form of eye-catching Chinese lanterns and patio furniture cushions.
Find the right shade. 
There are so many different types of oranges available that it's nearly impossible not to find at least one that suits your taste. 
In the bedroom, a burnt orange accent wall can add a sensual flare while bright, friendly golden orange patterned throw pillows can fit nicely in your living room space. 
Remember that the shade of orange you choose can change the entire mood of a room.
Use orange as part of an overall theme. 
Contrary to popular beliefs, themed rooms don't have to be tacky. 
Combine your orange with Earth tones for a Southwestern flare, or add in some deep blues to bring your tropical theme to life.
Orange can bring great dimension to a room, so don't be afraid to add it to your design.
