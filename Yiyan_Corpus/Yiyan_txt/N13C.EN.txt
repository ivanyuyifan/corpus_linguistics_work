Sleeping out
He had always thought the Sahara would be white, but it wasn't; it was terra-cotta brown.
The rolling sand dunes were the curves of her body the summer they met and the following summer they married.
That hill was the slope of her back, and over there was the valley between her shoulder blades where he kissed her each night as they lay in bed.
It had been her desire to ride a camel through the Sahara and to see the world and to be filled with it.
She married him, and he promised that someday, after all their hard work, they would travel the world together.
And now here he was, without the one person he had promised to bring.
Enveloped in an untamed wind, his eyes and nose filled with sand.
He took a small plastic film canister from his pocket, removed the lid, and the heaving storm lapped out the bottle's contents.
An ounce of the ashes of the love of his life disappeared into the desert around him.
He leaned his body against the wind. It stung his face, burned his nose, and he glared at the desert and tried to blink the Sahara out of his eyes.
The wind blew harder, he fell to his knees, pressed his forehead to the ground, and kissed the silty earth.
Under the ever-maddening red desert moon the old man watched a wall of sand stalking toward him.
