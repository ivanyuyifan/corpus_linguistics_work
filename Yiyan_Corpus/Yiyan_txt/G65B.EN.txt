Chinese philosophies endow my writing with an angelic glamour
One afternoon, when I was eight years old, I was going to the grocer's with Mom. 
Pointing at a man riding a bike on the street, Mother said:"He must be madman. 
He even knows Chinese." 
Today I still remember what that man looked like: he had a head of blown-up hair like Einstein's, and what was more frightening was its fiery-red color. 
At that moment I believed I had seen a real devil.
In 1966, I was at the senior high school which offered Latin and French as foreign languages. 
I was very keen on Latin and French poetry. 
One day I was browsing through the poetry shelves at the school library. 
When I picked from the shelf an anthology of poems by the American poet Ezra Pound, a thin booklet next to it fell to the floor. 
I picked it up and found it was a collection of Pound's translations of Chinese classical poetry. 
I was astonished that there had ever been poetry composed by Chinese. 
I thumbed through a few pages and was glued to it: never had I read poetry in such refreshing styles.
One week later, I went to Arthur Waley, an English sinologist of the early20th century, and borrowed his The Opium War, which surprised me again. 
In English textbooks of history not a single word about the war was mentioned and the average Englishmen simply did not know anything about it. 
It was but a small and short-lived battle or a trade conflict taking place locally in East Asia, so it deserved no mention at all when compared with the more important events happening then in the large number of British colonies in Southeast Asia, Central Asia, Africa and Australia. 
However, after I had read The Opium War, I felt like reading more about China, so I borrowed Waley's translation of Chinese poetry.
