7 Ways to Make a Baby Laugh 
Most babies have fairly a predictable sense of humor and often the thing that makes them happiest is your big, smiling face. 
Fortunately, babies don't care if we're wearing makeup, they think we smell like love itself, and your coffee-stained bathrobe feels just as wonderful to them whether it's been washed this week or not. 
If your baby could talk she'd say, "Mom, don't worry about the zit on your nose, let's both hide under this blanket for awhile. 
There, isn't that cozy?" (Your baby is off-the-charts empathetic, by the way -- most kids aren't that tuned in until they're seven. 
What an amazing parent you are!)
As babies get into their first year, though, it's fun to find new ways to crack them up.
Feathers. 
For the baby who doesn't like being aggressively tickled, a feather can do the trick. (Freeze the feather overnight first to kill anything that might be living in it. 
Ugh, or maybe skip the feather and tickle her with a cotton ball.)
Peek-a-who? 
Your giant, amazing face popping out from behind almost anything will get a laugh, once Baby catches on to what's happening. 
Warning: once they get the joke, they will want you to do this 10,000 times in a row.
Other babies. 
The first time my son met another child his age he almost died of delight. 
If you don't have a playmate handy, babies also love pictures of other babies faces. 
Mrs. Mustard's Baby Faces book was the go-to cheerer-upper in our house that first year.
