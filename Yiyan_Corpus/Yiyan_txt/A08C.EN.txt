Obama outlines vision for space 
US President rallies support at NASA despite unpopular cuts to the Constellation rocket programme.
President Barack Obama touched down in somewhat hostile territory at Florida's John F. Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral yesterday. 
His mission: to promote and expand on the widely criticized space-exploration plans he announced in his 2011 budget request in February, and convince the country that his vision is specific, achievable and as inspirational as past space triumphs.
The President's plan calls for a $6 billion increase over the next five years in NASA's overall budget, which is currently just under $19 billion. 
Besides expanding Earth observations, key components include ending the Constellation programme initiated by former president George W. Bush, which aimed to develop new rockets and capsules that would put astronauts back on the Moon, but which is behind schedule and over budget.
Instead, Obama wants NASA to enlist private companies to ferry astronauts to and from the International Space Station, whose lifespan the President would extend by 5 years from 2015 to 2020.
