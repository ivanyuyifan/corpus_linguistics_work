The Generalissimo: Chiang Kshek and the Struggle for Modern China Chiang and His American Allies (6) 
In November, Chiang told Stilwell that fifteen Chinese divisions would be ready for the offensive to retake Burma in the spring of 1943, and he promised to send another Chinese division to India (by air), raising the "X Force" there to three divisions. 
Stilwell flew to India and informed General Archibald Wavell, still the overall commander in Burma, of the intention to proceed with the campaign "on the assumption that the Generalissimo's requirement of Allied naval and air dominance of the Bay of Bengal would be met." 
But the British were not enthusiastic about any sort of attack into Burma. 
Like Chiang Kai-shek, the field marshal emphasized that the Allies "must not risk a second reverse in Burma."
 At the same time the War Department advised Chiang- in a message contravening the pledges of aircraft and other assistance that Roosevelt had given Chiang only the previous month- that because of other "urgent needs" he was not to expect any significant new support. 
Stilwell and Chiang were both irate. 
In an angry message, the general complained to the War Department that if this was the attitude of the United States, "it would be extremely difficult to persuade the Chinese to go forward in Burma."
"Peanut and I are on a raft, with one sandwich between us," he wrote his wife, "and the rescue ship is heading away from the scene. 
They are too busy for small fry like us."
Once Stilwell calmed down, however, he simply adopted Wavell's plan for a campaign limited to North Burma, a plan he had previously denounced, but felt was better than nothing.
