Adobe¡¯s Plan to Make Your iPad as Good as Your Desktop
FOR SOME TIME now, the iPad has struggled to gain meaningful traction with users. 
Heralded in 2010 as the Goldilocks just-right device for tasks like checking email, browsing online, and playing games, that was no longer the case just a few years later. 
Today we have much bigger smartphones, featherlight laptops, and a flimsy understanding of how to best put our midsize tablets to use.
Apple¡¯s latest addition to the iPad lineup, the iPad Pro, aims to resolve this confusion. 
It¡¯s a bigger, more powerful tablet that Apple Senior VP Phil Schiller demoed onstage with some of Adobe¡¯s new apps. 
It was a particularly fitting way to introduce a device meant for work, because Adobe has, for more than a year now, been pushing for professional creativity on mobile devices.
CreativeSync, a new Adobe technology, is the company¡¯s latest bid to make that happen.
CreativeSync runs in the background of Adobe¡¯s cloud and is like a seamless, 360-degree bridge linking all of Adobe¡¯s apps (third party apps get access soon). 
If you¡¯re editing an image in Photoshop, but need to quickly add text in InDesign, then bounce the file back to Photoshop, CreativeSync lets you do this with a couple of quick taps. 
The goal, plain and simple, is to turn mobile platforms into a places you can actually do work.
