John Lennon
John Lennon was born with a gift for music and comedy that would carry him further from his roots than he ever dreamed possible. 
As a young man, he was lured away from the British Isles by the seemingly bound less glamour and opportunity to be found cross the Atlantic. 
He achieved that rare feat for a British per former of taking American music to the Americans and playing it as convincingly as any homegrown practitioner, or even more so. 
For several years, his group toured the country, delighting audiences in city after city with their garish suits,funny hair, and contagiously happy grins.
This, of course, was not Beatle John Lennon but his namesake paternal grandfather, more commonly known as Jack, born in 1855. 
Lennon is an Irish surname-from O'Leannain or O'Lonain-and Jack habitually gave his birthplace as Dublin, though there is evidence that his family had already crossed the Irish Sea to become part of Liverpool's extensive Hibernian community some time previously. 
He began his working life as a clerk, but in the 1880s fol lowed a common impulse among his compatriots and emigrated to New York. 
Whereas the city turned other immigrant Irishmen into laborers or police officers, Jack wound up as a member of Andrew Roberton's Colored Operatic Kentucky Minstrels.
However brief or casual his involvement, this made him part of the first transatlantic popular music industry. 
American minstrel troupes, in which white men blackened their faces, put on outsize collars and stripey pantaloons, and sang sentimental choruses about the Swanee River, "coons," and "darkies," were hugely popular in the late nineteenth century, both as performers and creators of hit songs.
