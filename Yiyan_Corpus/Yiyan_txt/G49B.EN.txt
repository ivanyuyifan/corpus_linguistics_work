Reminiscence of a Stock Operator Chapter 1 (2) 
I wasn't interested in doubling my money, but in his saying that Burlington was going up. 
If it was, my note-book ought to show it. 
I looked. 
Sure enough, Burlington, according to my figuring, was acting as it usually did before it went up. 
I had never bought or sold anything in my life, and I never gambled with the other boys. 
But all I could see was that this was a grand chance to test the accuracy of my work, of my hobby. 
It struck me at once that if my dope didn't work in practice there was nothing in the theory of it to interest anybody. 
So I gave him all I had, and with our pooled resources he went to one of the nearby bucket shops and bought some Burlington. 
Two days later we cashed in. 
I made a profit of $3.12.
After that first trade, I got to speculating on my own hook in the bucket shops. 
I'd go during my lunch hour and buy or sell it never made any difference to me. 
I was playing a system and not a favorite stock or backing opinions. 
All I knew was the arithmetic of it. 
As a matter of fact, mine was the ideal way to operate in a bucket shop, where all that a trader does is to bet on fluctuations as they are printed by the ticker on the tape.
It was not long before I was taking much more money out of the bucket shops than I was pulling down from my job in the brokerage office. 
So I gave up my position. 
My folks objected, but they couldn't say much when they saw what I was making. 
I was only a kid and office-boy wages were not very high. 
I did mighty well on my own hook.
I was fifteen when I had my first thousand and laid the cash in front of my mother all made in the bucket shops in a few months, besides what I had taken home. 
My mother carried on something awful. 
She wanted me to put it away in the savings bank out of reach of temptation. 
She said it was more money than she ever heard any boy of fifteen had made, starting with nothing. 
She didn't quite believe it was real money. 
She used to worry and fret about it. 
But I didn't think of anything except that I could keep on proving my figuring was right. 
That's all the fun there is being right by using your head. 
If I was right when I tested my convictions with ten shares I would be ten times more right if I traded in a hundred shares. That is all that having more margin meant to me I was right more emphatically. More courage? No! No difference! 
If all I have is ten dollars and I risk it, I am much braver than when I risk a million, if I have another million salted away.
Anyhow, at fifteen I was making a good living out of the stock market. 
I began in the smaller bucket shops, where the man who traded in twenty shares at a clip was suspected of being John W. Gates in disguise or J. P. Morgan traveling incognito. 
Bucket shops in those days seldom lay down on their customers. 
They didn't have to. 
There were other ways of parting customers from their money, even when they guessed right. 
The business was tremendously profitable. 
When it was conducted legitimately I mean straight, as far as the bucket shop went the fluctuations took care of the shoestrings. 
It doesn't take much of a reaction to wipe out a margin of only three quarters of a point. 
Also, no welsher could ever get back in the game. 
Wouldn't have any trade.
I didn't have a following. I kept my business to myself. 
It' was a one-man business, anyhow. 
It was my head, wasn't it? 
Prices either were going the way I doped them out, without any help from friends or partners, or they were going the other way, and nobody could stop them out of kindness to me. 
I couldn't see where I needed to tell my business to anybody else. 
I've got friends, of course, but my business has always been the same a one-man affair. 
That is why I have always Played a lone hand.
As it was, it didn't take long for the bucket shops to get sore on me for beating them. 
I'd walk in and plank down my margin, but they'd look at it without making a move to grab it. They'd tell me there was nothing doing. 
That was the time they got to calling me the Boy Plunger.
