Make Your Own Shaving Cream 
My favorite part about caring for the environment is that it encourages the D.I.Y. spirit. 
I've always been a little on the crafty side and am more than happy to make something myself if it means that I'll save money and help out the planet by reducing my own consumption of chemical-infused products that are also often times packaging nightmares.
