Jack Welch 17
She took me to the bleachers in Fenway Park to watch Ted Williams play left field for the Boston Red Sox. 
She'd pick me up at school in the early afternoon and drive me over to the country club so I could get a head start on the other caddies. 
A devout Catholic, she'd drive me to St. Thomas the Apostle Church so I could serve the six A.M. mass as an altar boy, with her praying in the first row in the right pew.
She became my most enthusiastic cheerleaders, calling up the local newspapers and asking them to carry items about my small triumphs, from graduating from the University of Massachusetts to earning my Ph.D. 
Then she'd paste each clipping into a big scrapbook. 
She was shame less that way.
My mother was clearly the disciplinarian in the family. 
When my father once caught me on his train headed home after I'd skipped school to celebrate St. Patrick's Day in South Boston, he didn't say anything in front my friends??even though all of us were juiced on some cheap 50-cents-a-bottle muscatel.
Instead he simply told my mother, who confronted me and doled out the punishment. 
Another time, I cut altar boy practice to play hockey on the frozen pond at Mack Park near my home. 
During the game, I fell through the ice and got completely soaked. 
To try to cover up what happened, I stripped off my wet clothes and hung them on a tree over a fire we built. We shivered in the January cold waiting for our clothes to dry.
It was, I thought, a rather clever cover-up??until I walked through the front door.
It took a second for my mother to smell the smoke on my clothes. 
Ducking altar boy practice was a big deal to someone who hung a crucifix on the wall, prayed the rosary, and considered Father James Cronin, the longtime pastor of my church, a saint. 
So she sat me down, forced out a confession, and the delivered her own penance. Whacking me with a damp shoe she'd just taken off my foot.
