How to make a lamb mobile
Make a lamb mobile with Maggy Woodley from Red Ted Art, in the fourth of our series of simple Easter crafts to make with children 
In many countries, lambs are a symbol of Easter- and they certainly are a symbol of spring. 
We love these little lambs as they are quick and easy to make. 
You can make them in all sorts of colours and, if you so wish, assemble them to make a mobile. 
My son currently wants to make one a day!
Materials
Card stock (white or black is ideal, but any colour is fine), cotton wool, glue, scissors and a pen
Method
This lamb comes in three parts: the body, legs and tail are one part and the head is made in two parts.
Fold your card in half. 
Draw on a body, legs and tail - then cut. 
The fold forms the back of the lamb and runs all along the tail.
Cut out two oval shapes for the head and glue on- part of each oval will be glued to the body, the other part to the second oval. 
This gives the lamb a little structure and prevents the legs from spreading out too far.
Stick on lots of cotton wool (my son's favourite bit).
Draw on eyes, ears and a mouth.
Hang with some cotton or a ribbon or just play with them (we do).
