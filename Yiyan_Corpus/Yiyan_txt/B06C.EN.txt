Great-power politics: The new game
American dominance is being challenged
A CONTINENT separates the blood-soaked battlefields of Syria from the reefs and shoals that litter the South China Sea. In their different ways, however, both places are witnessing the most significant shift in great-power relations since the collapse of the Soviet Union.
In Syria, for the first time since the cold war, Russia has deployed its forces far from home to quell a revolution and support a client regime. 
In the waters between Vietnam and the Philippines, America will soon signal that it does not recognise China¡¯s territorial claims over a host of outcrops and reefs by exercising its right to sail within the 12-mile maritime limit that a sovereign state controls.
For the past 25 years America has utterly dominated great-power politics. Increasingly, it lives in a contested world. 
The new game with Russia and China that is unfolding in Syria and the South China Sea is a taste of the struggle ahead.
Facts on the ground
As ever, that struggle is being fought partly in terms of raw power. 
Vladimir Putin has intervened in Syria to tamp down jihadism and to bolster his own standing at home. 
But he also means to show that, unlike America, Russia can be trusted to get things done in the Middle East and win friends by, for example, offering Iraq an alternative to the United States (see article). 
Lest anyone presume with John McCain, an American senator, that Russia is just ¡°a gas station masquerading as a country¡±, Mr Putin intends to prove that Russia possesses resolve, as well as crack troops and cruise missiles.
The struggle is also over legitimacy. 
Mr Putin wants to discredit America¡¯s stewardship of the international order. America argues that popular discontent and the Syrian regime¡¯s abuses of human rights disqualify the president, Bashar al-Assad, from power.
