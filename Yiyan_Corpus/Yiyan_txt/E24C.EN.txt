Zen Mind: How to Declutter
Here are my top decluttering tips:
Do it in small chunks. 
Set aside just 15 minutes to declutter just one shelf, and when that shelf or that 15 minutes is up, celebrate your victory. 
Then tackle another shelf for 15 minutes the next day. 
Conquering an entire closet or room can be overwhelming, and you might put it off forever. 
If that¡¯s the case, just do it in baby steps.
Set aside a couple hours to do it. 
This may seem contradictory to the above tip ¡­ and it is. 
It¡¯s simply a different strategy, and I say do whatever works for you. 
Sometimes, for me, it¡¯s good to set aside part of a morning, or an entire Saturday morning, to declutter a closet or room. 
I do it all at once, and when I¡¯m done, it feels awesome.
Take everything out of a shelf or drawer at once. 
Whichever of the two above strategies you choose, you should focus on one drawer or shelf at a time, and empty it completely.
