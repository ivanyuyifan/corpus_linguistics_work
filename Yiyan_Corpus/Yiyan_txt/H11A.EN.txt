An Introduction to New York University
The founding of New York University in 1831 by a group of eminent private citizens was a historic event in American education. 
In the early 19th century, a major emphasis in higher education was on the mastery of Greek and Latin, with little attention given to modern or contemporary subjects. 
The founders of New York University intended to enlarge the scope of higher education to meet the needs of persons aspiring to careers in business, industry, science, and the arts, as well as in law, medicine, and the ministry. 
The opening of the University of London in 1828 convinced New Yorkers that New York, too, should have a university.
The first president of New York University¡¯s governing council was Albert Gallatin, former adviser to Thomas Jefferson and secretary of the treasury in Jefferson¡¯s cabinet. 
Gallatin and his cofounders said that the new university was to be a ¡°national university¡± that would provide a ¡°rational and practical education for all.¡±
The result of the founders¡¯ foresight is today a university that is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in scholarship. 
Of the more than 3,000 colleges and universities in America, only 60 institutions are members of the distinguished Association of American Universities. 
New York University is one of the 60. 
Students come to the University from all 50 states and from 133 foreign countries.
The University includes 14 schools and colleges at six major centers in Manhattan. 
In addition, the University operates a branch campus program in Rockland County at St. Thomas Aquinas College.
