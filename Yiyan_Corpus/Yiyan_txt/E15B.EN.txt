Kale and Quinoa Salad 
I created this speedy, simple dish with Marisa Miller Wolfson in mind. 
It features two -- no, three -- of her vegan faves -- quinoa, kale and nutritional yeast. 
Vegucate yourself -- nutritional yeast is not weird. 
It provides a big B-12 boost and terrific cheesy flavor sans animal.

Tart this dish up with a handful of your favorite chopped herbs, pair it with grilled vegetables or tempeh or serve with a salad.
1 cup quinoa, rinsed in and drained
2 cups water or vegetable broth
1/3 cup pine nuts
2 tablespoons olive oil
2 cloves garlic, chopped
1 pinch red pepper flakes
1 big bunch kale (about 3 cups), tough sterms removed, leaves sliced into skinny bite-sized ribbons
2 tablespoons nutritional yeast
1/2 cup white wine 
sea salt and fresh ground pepper to taste 
In a medium-sized pot, bring water or vegetable broth to boil. 
Add quinoa. Reduce heat to low and cover. Cook quinoa for about 12 to 15 minutes or until all liquid is absorbed and quinoa is plumped. 
Remove from burner and set aside to cool. Place a large dry skillet over medium-high heat. Add pine nuts. Toast nuts, stirring or give pan a shake every few minutes, until nuts are golden brown and smell luscious and buttery, about 5 minutes.
Pour pine nuts into a small bowl and set aside.
Pour the olive oil into the skillet and return to heat.
Add chopped garlic and cook, stirring, until garlic turns soft and golden, about 5 minutes.
Add kale by the handful and stir until kale is just wilted, 3 to 5 minutes.
Stir in quinoa, nutritional yeast wine and season to taste. Cook another few minutes or until heated through. Add pine nuts and toss to combine.
