5 Tips For Storing Your Fragrances 
Fragrance, like other cosmetics, has a shelf life. 
But unlike most makeup, it can be hard to replace, extremely expensive, and once something happens to it, there's no putting it back together. 
Because fragrance is so vulnerable to degradation from a number of factors, smart storage practices are important. 
Want to know how to keep your favorite fragrances smelling exactly as they should for as long as possible? 
Here's what to do.
Keep them away from temperature extremes. 
Most of the time, this means heat, but people who attempt to put their scents in the freezer to keep them fresh often also end up destroying the integrity of the fragrances. 
The best temperature is a good bit colder than a comfortable room, around 55-60 degrees.
