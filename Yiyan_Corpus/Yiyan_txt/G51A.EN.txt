Jack Welch 16
One summer job really taught me a lesson. 
It convinced me what I didn't want to do. 
I was operating a drill press at the Parker Brothers game plant in Salem. My job was to take a small piece of cork, drill a hole though it by pushing down a pedal with my foot, and then toss the cork into a big round cardboard drum. 
Every day, I did thousands of them.
To pass the time, I'd play a game by trying to cover the bottom of the barrel with corks I drilled before the foreman came along to empty it out. 
I rarely made it. 
Talk about frustration, I'd go home with headaches. I hated it. I didn't last three weeks, but it taught me a lot.
My early years were spent with my nose pressed up against the glass. 
Every summer before I was old enough to work, the kids from the Salem playground took a special train to Old Orchard Beach, an amusement park in Maine. 
This was our summer highlight. 
We'd board the train at six-thirty A.M. and arrive there two hours later. 
Within a couple of hours, by running from ride to ride, most of us had used up the five bucks or so that we brought.
We still had a full day ahead of us and were broke. 
My friends and I would them comb the beach for returnable bottles, going from blanket to blanket asking sunbathers for their empties. 
At two cents a bottle, that got us enough money for a hot dog and a few more rides before returning home.
On the other hand, I never felt deprived, I didn't want for much of anything. 
My parents made many sacrifices for me, making sure I had a great baseball glove or a good bicycle. 
And my father allowed my mother to spoil me, without ever taking any of the credit. And she did.
