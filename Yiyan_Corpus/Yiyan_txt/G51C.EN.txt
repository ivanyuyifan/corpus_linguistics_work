Jack Welch 18
While she could be strict, she could also be a real "softie." 
Once, when I was not much more than 11 years old, I stole a ball from a carnival that came through town. You know, the type of lousy ball you throw to knock metal milk bottles off a pedestal to win a Kewpie doll.
It didn't take long before my mother found the ball and asked me where I got it. 
When I admitted that I had stolen it, she insisted that I go to Father Cronin, return the ball to him, and then confess what I did. 
Since all the priests knew me as an altar boy, I was convinced that they'd recognize me in the confessional the second I opened my mouth. I was scared of them.
Another time, when I was a senior in high school, I was caddying for one of the stingiest members of the Kernwood Country Club. 
By that time, I had been a caddy there for eight years-which was probably a little long for my own good. 
We got to the sixth hole, a tee where the drive had to go only about a hundred yards to carry the pond. 
This day, my guy topped his ball straight into the water. 
It landed at least ten feet into the muddy pond. 
He asked me to take my shoes and socks off and wade into the pond after his ball.
I refused, and when he insisted I told him to go to bell. I tossed his clubs into the water, told him to get his ball and clubs himself, and ran off the course.
It was a stupid thing to do, even worse than flinging my hockey stick across the ice. 
Even though my mother was disappointed, because this incident cost me the club's caddy scholarship, she seemed to understand what I felt and didn't make as much of a big deal out of it as she might have.
