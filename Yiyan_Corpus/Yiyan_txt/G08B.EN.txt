Ten years at the top for Vladimir Putin  
Much has changed in the 10 years since Vladimir Putin first became Russia's president.

James Rodgers assesses the rise and rise of the spy who came to control the Kremlin. 
Cast your mind back to 31 December 1999. 
In Moscow, it is the last day of a century that has seen revolution and the collapse of communism. 
Everyone in the Russian capital is waiting for reassurance from regions further east, where the new millennium has already started, that Russia's nuclear power stations are still safe - now that the date on their computers has changed to 2000. 
The main news of the day comes as a surprise. Boris Yeltsin, Russia's first post-Soviet leader, announces his resignation. 
Vladimir Putin takes over as acting president. 
There is war in Chechnya. The economy is still reeling from Russia's defaulting on its debt a year earlier 
Tough, and rough  
Mr Putin "came into a virtual failed state", says Sergei Karaganov, a former advisor to Mr Yeltsin, and now dean of Moscow's Higher School of Economics. 
He has watched both Mr Putin, and Russia, change. 
"He is bright, even brilliant, very tough, sometimes rough. 
He is a street boy turned into a very sophisticated political functionary and manipulator."  
This description sums up Vladimir Putin's great versatility as a politician: he can seem equally comfortable wearing an expensive suit and discussing economic issues with world leaders, or sharing a joke with soldiers and speaking their slang.
