We can come here once again ", said Julia. " It's generally safe to use any hide-out twice.
But not for another month or two, of course. "
As soon as she woke up her demeanour had changed.
She became alert and business-like, put her clothes on, knotted the scarlet sash about her waist, and began arranging the details of the journey home.
It seemed natural to leave this to her.
She obviously had a practical cunning which Winston lacked, and she seemed also to have an exhaustive knowledge of the countryside round London, stored away from innumerable community hikes.
The route she gave him was quite different from the one by which he had come, and brought him out at a different railway station.
"Never go home the same way as you went out ", she said, as though enunciating an important general principle.
She would leave first, and Winston was to wait half an hour before following her.
She had named a place where they could meet after work, four evenings hence.
It was a street in one of the poorer quarters, where there was an open market which was generally crowded and noisy.
She would be hanging about among the stalls, pretending to be in search of shoelaces or sewing-thread.
If she judged that the coast was clear she would blow her nose when he approached; otherwise he was to walk past her without recognition.
But with luck, in the middle of the crowd, it would be safe to talk for a quarter of an hour and arrange another meeting.
And now I must go , she said as soon as he had mastered his instructions.
"I'm due back at nineteen-thirty.
I've got to put in two hours for the Junior Anti-Sex League, handing out leaflets, or something.
Isn't it bloody?
Give me a brush-down, would you?
Have I got any twigs in my hair? Are you sure?
Then good-bye, my love, good-bye!"
She flung herself into his arms, kissed him almost violently, and a moment later pushed her way through the saplings and disappeared into the wood with very little noise.
Even now he had not found out her surname or her address.
However, it made no difference, for it was inconceivable that they could ever meet indoors or exchange any kind of written communication.
There were evenings when they reached their rendezvous and then had to walk past one another without a sign, because a patrol had just come round the corner or a helicopter was hovering overhead.
Even if it had been less dangerous, it would still have been difficult to find time to meet.
Winston's working week was sixty hours, Julia's was even longer, and their free days varied according to the pressure of work and did not often coincide.
Julia, in any case, seldom had an evening completely free.
She spent an astonishing amount of time in attending lectures and demonstrations, distributing literature for the junior Anti-Sex League, preparing banners for Hate Week, making collections for the savings campaign, and such-like activities.
It paid, she said, it was camouflage.
If you kept the small rules, you could break the big ones.
She even induced Winston to mortgage yet another of his evenings by enrolling himself for the part-time munition work which was done voluntarily by zealous Party members.
So, one evening every week, Winston spent four hours of paralysing boredom, screwing together small bits of metal which were probably parts of bomb fuses, in a draughty, ill-lit workshop where the knocking of hammers mingled drearily with the music of the telescreens.
When they met in the church tower the gaps in their fragmentary conversation were filled up.
It was a blazing afternoon. The air in the little square chamber above the bells was hot and stagnant, and smelt overpoweringly of pigeon dung.
They sat talking for hours on the dusty, twig-littered floor, one or other of them getting up from time to time to cast a glance through the arrowslits and make sure that no one was coming.
Julia was twenty-six years old.
She lived in a hostel with thirty other girls ( " Always in the stink of women ! How I hate women ! " she said parenthetically ), and she worked, as he had guessed, on the novel-writing machines in the Fiction Department.
She enjoyed her work, which consisted chiefly in running and servicing a powerful but tricky electric motor. She was "not clever", but was fond of using her hands and felt at home with machinery.
She could describe the whole process of composing a novel, from the general directive issued by the Planning Committee down to the final touching-up by the Rewrite Squad. But she was not interested in the finished product.
She " didn't much care for reading ", she said.
Books were just a commodity that had to be produced, like jam or bootlaces.
She had no memories of anything before the early 'sixties and the only person she had ever known who talked frequently of the days before the Revolution was a grandfather who had disappeared when she was eight.
At school she had been captain of the hockey team and had won the gymnastics trophy two years running. She had been a troop-leader in the Spies and a branch secretary in the Youth League before joining the Junior Anti-Sex League.
She had always borne an excellent character. She had even (an infallible mark of good reputation) been picked out to work in Pornosec, the sub-section of the Fiction Department which turned out cheap pornography for distribution among the proles.
It was nicknamed Muck House by the people who worked in it, she remarked.
There she had remained for a year, helping to produce booklets in sealed packets with titles like Spanking Stories or One Night in a Girls' School, to be bought furtively by proletarian youths who were under the impression that they were buying something illegal.
What are these books like? said Winston curiously.
"Oh, ghastly rubbish.
They're boring, really.
They only have six plots, but they swap them round a bit.
Of course I was only on the kaleidoscopes.
I was never in the Rewrite Squad.
I'm not literary, dear - not even enough for that."
"He learned with astonishment that all the workers in Pornosec, except the heads of the departments, were girls. The theory was that men, whose sex instincts were less controllable than those of women, were in greater danger of being corrupted by the filth they handled."
They don't even like having married women there ", she added. Girls are always supposed to be so pure. Here's one who isn't, anyway.
She had had her first love-affair when she was sixteen, with a Party member of sixty who later committed suicide to avoid arrest. "And a good job too, said Julia, " otherwise they'd have had my name out of him when he confessed.
"Since then there had been various others. Life as she saw it was quite simple. You wanted a good time; " they", meaning the Party, wanted to stop you having it; you broke the rules as best you could. She seemed to think it just as natural that "they" should want to rob you of your pleasures as that you should want to avoid being caught.
She hated the Party, and said so in the crudest words, but she made no general criticism of it.
Except where it touched upon her own life she had no interest in Party doctrine.
He noticed that she never used Newspeak words except the ones that had passed into everyday use.
She had never heard of the Brotherhood, and refused to believe in its existence. Any kind of organized revolt against the Party, which was bound to be a failure, struck her as stupid.
The clever thing was to break the rules and stay alive all the same.
He wondered vaguely how many others like her there might be in the younger generation people who had grown up in the world of the Revolution, knowing nothing else, accepting the Party as something unalterable, like the sky, not rebelling against its authority but simply evading it, as a rabbit dodges a dog.
They did not discuss the possibility of getting married.
It was too remote to be worth thinking about. No imaginable committee would ever sanction such a marriage even if Katharine, Winston's wife, could somehow have been got rid of.
It was hopeless even as a daydream.
What was she like, your wife? said Julia.
She was - do you know the Newspeak word goodthinkful?
Meaning naturally orthodox, incapable of thinking a bad thought?
No, I didn't know the word, but I know the kind of person, right enough.
He began telling her the story of his married life, but curiously enough she appeared to know the essential parts of it already.
She described to him, almost as though she had seen or felt it, the stiffening of Katharine's body as soon as he touched her, the way in which she still seemed to be pushing him from her with all her strength, even when her arms were clasped tightly round him.
With Julia he felt no difficulty in talking about such things: Katharine, in any case, had long ceased to be a painful memory and became merely a distasteful one.
I could have stood it if it hadn't been for one thing , he said.
He told her about the frigid little ceremony that Katharine had forced him to go through on the same night every week.
" She hated it, but nothing would make her stop doing it. She used to call it - but you'll never guess. "
Our duty to the Party , said Julia promptly.
How did you know that?
I've been at school too, dear.
Sex talks once a month for the over-sixteens.
And in the Youth Movement. They rub it into you for years.
I dare say it works in a lot of cases.
But of course you can never tell; people are such hypocrites.
She began to enlarge upon the subject.
With Julia, everything came back to her own sexuality.
As soon as this was touched upon in any way she was capable of great acuteness. Unlike Winston, she had grasped the inner meaning of the Party's sexual puritanism.
It was not merely that the sex instinct created a world of its own which was outside the Party's control and which therefore had to be destroyed if possible. What was more important was that sexual privation induced hysteria, which was desirable because it could be transformed into war-fever and leader-worship.
The way she put it was :
When you make love you're using up energy ; and afterwards you feel happy and don't give a damn for anything.
They can't bear you to feel like that. They want you to be bursting with energy all the time. All this marching up and down and cheering and waving flags is simply sex gone sour.
If you're happy inside yourself, why should you get excited about Big Brother and the Three-Year Plans and the Two Minutes Hate and all the rest of their bloody rot?
That was very true, he thought.
There was a direct intimate connexion between chastity and political orthodoxy.
For how could the fear, the hatred, and the lunatic credulity which the Party needed in its members be kept at the right pitch, except by bottling down some powerful instinct and using it as a driving force?
The sex impulse was dangerous to the Party, and the Party had turned it to account.
They had played a similar trick with the instinct of parenthood.
The family could not actually be abolished, and, indeed, people were encouraged to be fond of their children, in almost the old-fashioned way. The children, on the other hand, were systematically turned against their parents and taught to spy on them and report their deviations.
The family had become in effect an extension of the Thought Police.
It was a device by means of which everyone could be surrounded night and day by informers who knew him intimately.
