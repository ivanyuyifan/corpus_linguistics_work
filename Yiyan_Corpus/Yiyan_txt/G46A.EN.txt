A poet¡¯s life
FEW knew what to make of Marianne Moore. 
By the time she died in 1972 she had been hailed as one of America¡¯s greatest modernist poets. 
And yet her poetry puzzled most people. 
A wave of 1970s feminist criticism ignored her. 
Journalists preferred to characterise her as an eccentric spinster, fond of wearing a tricorne hat and cape. 
Even the poets who adored her found her strange and surprising. 
William Carlos Williams, another poet, once remarked on hearing her laugh: ¡°How slight a woman can so roar, like a secret Niagara.¡±
¡°Holding On Upside Down¡± is the first authorised biography. 
Linda Leavell, an American academic, was granted access to previously unseen archival documents and letters. 
The result is a thorough examination of a remarkable life.
Moore was born in Missouri in 1887. Soon afterwards, her father was committed to a psychiatric hospital for religious mania (he later cut off his own hand, literally interpreting a passage from the Bible). 
Her mother, Mary, moved Moore and her older brother, Warner, to Pennsylvania and embarked on a lesbian relationship with a woman called Mary Norcross for several years. 
Seven years after graduating, Moore moved with her mother to New York; they lived together for the next 36 years.
The Moores¡¯ domestic life was claustrophobic. 
Everything the poet wrote was read by her mother and scrutinised accordingly. 
Although she did not keep a diary, her life is well documented: when Moore was away from her mother she would send her detailed letters up to 150 pages long. 
Warner regularly wrote to his mother and sister, so much so that he had to hide the fact from his jealous wife. 
They called each other nicknames after characters from ¡°The Wind in the Willows¡±, a children¡¯s book. 
When literary figures came to call on Moore, it would often be her mother who did most of the talking.
