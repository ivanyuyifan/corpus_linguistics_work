Chou Enlai: Some Personal Recollections 
Western politicians in their messages of condolence acclaimed Chou Enlai as one of the greatest statesmen of our era, which undoubtedly he was. 
The Western newspaper obituaries have stressed Chou's intelligence, his urbanity and above all his "pragmatism". 
But Chou Enlai was much more than a brilliant, almost indefatigable, administrator.
My first meeting with Premier Chou Enlai was at a small dinner given for Field-Marshal Montgomery in 1960. 
Looking up my notes I find that this is what I wrote at the time: 
Chou Enlai arrived. 
I watched him, fascinated by his gestures and by the rapid alterations in his expression. 
An extraordinary mobile face, now ironical, now jesting, now with his head thrown back in laughter; then at some comment, instantly alert and attentive. 
Here without doubt was one of the most outstanding figures of modern history. 
He had been in the thick of it from the very start? A quarter of a million dollars on his head, he walked unguarded among the peasants. 
What was one to read in such a face? 
Tenacity, a lively humor, the keenest intelligence certainly; a man fully committed without divisions within himself; yet also, perhaps, with an ability to stand outside, cool, detached and thoughtful.
Looking through my notes I am reminded of another such reception. 
"I was standing near Chou Enlai when a girl attendant with a large tray of drinks came up and offered one to the Prime Minister. 
They stood chatting together as easily and naturally as could be, the girl without a trace of shyness or servility. 
With respect of course; but the respect, I felt, was both ways.
