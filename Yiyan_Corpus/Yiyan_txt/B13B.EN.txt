Tech Tip Tuesday: Pick A Browser That Fits 
A big part of the simple life is learning to choose the right tool, the one that is most simple for the task at hand. 
Sure, it may be possible to accomplish the task with an inferior, outdated tool, but you're making it harder and more complicated than it needs to be. 
And those little complications, the visual clutter, the little annoyances, they wear on us throughout the day and affect productivity and mood, more than most of us realize.
How much time do you spend online every day? 
An hour or two, or five, or eight? 
You may go to hundreds of different websites during that time, but there's one major tool that your using the entire time: your web browser. 
Browsers are our window into another world, the online world. 
Have you ever considered what window you're looking through? 
If your window to the outside world is hazy, you're not going to be able to see out as well. 
If the window glass you're looking through distorts things, you won't see them the way they were intended to be seen. 
If there is a bunch of knickknacks and doodads on the windowsill, it will distract you from what's outside!
