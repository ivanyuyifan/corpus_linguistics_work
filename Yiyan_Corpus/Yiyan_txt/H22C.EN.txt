A tourism report released last week by the China Tourism Academy, a tourism research institute under the National Tourism Administration, said the total revenue would include US$35 billion earned from overseas tourists, down five percent from last year, and RMB950 billion from domestic travelers, up eight percent from 2008.
The report said China expected to see 124 million inbound trips this year, down five percent from a year earlier. 
The number of inbound tours longer than one night would drop 10 percent to 48.2 million.
The report said the number of inbound trips declined 5 percent to 62 million in the first six months.
The academy said the outbreak of H1N1 in April added to the woes of the global tourism industry, which was suffering from the global economic recession.
It said it was unlikely inbound tourism would recover in the second half, but domestic and outbound tourism would increase if the spread of flu virus were curbed in China.
The report said the outbreak of the flu virus had a negative impact on the country's tourism, but tourism authorities had launched a series of stimulus plans to boost domestic tourism, such as promotion of rural tourism and tourism coupons, which helped buoy domestic tourism.
The first half-year saw one billion domestic trips, up 10 percent from a year ago, and a revenue of RMB500 billion, up 10 percent.
Domestic tours were expected to total 1.9 billion for the year, up 10 percent.
China's tourism revenue totaled RMB1.16 trillion last year, including RMB874.9 billion from local travelers and RMB283.9 billion from overseas tourists.
