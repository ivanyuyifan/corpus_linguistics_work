The British Museum was established in 1753, largely based on the collections of the physician and scientist Sir Hans Sloane.
The museum first opened to the public on 15 January 1759 in Montagu House in Bloomsbury, on the site of the current museum building. 
Its expansion over the following two and a half centuries has resulted in the creation of several branch institutions, the first being the British Museum of Natural History in South Kensington in 1887.
Until 1997, when the current British Library building opened to the public, replacing the old British Museum Reading Room, the British Museum was unique in that it housed both a national museum of antiquities and a national library in the same building.
The Museum was founded 250 years ago as an encyclopedia of nature and of art. 
Today it no longer houses collections of natural history, and the books and manuscripts it once held now form part of the independent British Library.
The Museum nevertheless preserves its universality in its collections of artifacts representing the cultures of the world, ancient and modern. 
The original 1753 collection has grown to over thirteen million objects at the British Museum, 70 million at the Natural History Museum and 150 million at the British Library.
The Round Reading Room, which was designed by the architect Sydney Smirke, opened in 1857. 
For almost 150 years researchers came here to consult the Museum's vast library. 
The Reading Room closed in 1997 when the national library (the British Library) moved to a new building at St Pancras.
Today it has been transformed into the Walter and Leonore Annenberg Centre. 
This contains the Paul Hamlyn Library of books about the Museum's collections, which is open to all visitors.
